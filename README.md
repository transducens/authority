MARC authority control

Bibliographic collections often compile records from distributed sources where variable normalization criteria have been applied. 

We have designed a tool to assist authority control of author names in the bibliographic catalogue.
The tool is based on a procedure which employs a similarity measure between author names or their variants,
complemented with a parser which interprets the dates associated with the creator.

The application of these techniques has enhanced the productivity of the cataloguing staff.
